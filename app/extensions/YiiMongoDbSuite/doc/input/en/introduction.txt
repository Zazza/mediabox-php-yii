This extension is an almost complete, ActiveRecord like support for MongoDB in Yii

It originally started as a fork of [MongoRecord](http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/mongorecord "MongoRecord")
extension written by [tyohan](http://www.yiiframework.com/user/31/ "tyohan"),
to fix some major bugs, and add full featured suite for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org "MongoDB") developers.

## Limitations:

- The main limitations are only those present in MongoDB itself, like the 4MB single document data limit. But That's not a big deal either.
- In it's current incarnation, This extension does NOT work with the OR operator. When we get it working we will remove this line and add an example.

## Requirements:

- Yii 1.1.5 is required
- MongoDB latest stable is recommended. Untested with older versions.

## Known bugs

- Remember, this is not complete yet. So at this stage, it can have some ;]
- If you find any please let me know
- As said before, it does not work with the OR operators
