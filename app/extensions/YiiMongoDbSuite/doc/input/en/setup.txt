Title: Setup
Author: Dariusz GÃ³recki <darek.krk@gmail.com>

---

In your main configuration file, witch is by default: `protected/config/main.php` config file.

Add the following to the file:

~~~
[php]
'import' => array(
	// ...
	'ext.YiiMongoDbSuite.*',
),

'components' => array(
	// ...
	'mongodb' => array(
		'class'				=> 'EMongoDB',
		'connectionString'	=> 'mongodb://localhost',
		'dbName'			=> 'myDatabaseName',
		'fsyncFlag'			=> false,
		'safeFlag'			=> false,
		'useCursor'			=> false,
	),
	// ...
),
~~~

- `connectionString`: 'localhost' should be changed to the ip or hostname of your host being connected to. For example if connecting
  to a server it might be `'connectionString' => 'mongodb://username@xxx.xx.xx.xx'` where xx.xx.xx.xx is the ip (or hostname)
  of your webserver or host.
- `dbName`: is the name you want the collections to be stored in. The database name.
- `fsyncFlag` and `safeFlag` - see the [Write Queries Flags Section][advanced.write-flags],
  **state of this flags has massive impact on behavior of this extension, PLEASE read the linked chapter!**
- `useCursor` flag see [Use cursor special topic][special#usecursorflag]
- For more info see the [MongoDB connection page on php.net](http://php.net/manual/en/mongo.connecting.php).

That's all you have to do for setup. You can use it very much like the active record.
Short example:

~~~
[php]
$client = new Client;
$client->first_name='something';
$client->save();
$clients = Client::model->findAll();
