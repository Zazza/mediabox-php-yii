# Basic informations about embedded documents

## Must know: {#mustknow}

- For performance reasons all models of embedded documents should extend from `EMongoEmbeddedDocument` class
- But the above is not a must, things will still work if you define as embedded child classes of regular `EMongoDocument`
- You can define as many embedded documents as you wish
- Every embedded document **can contain** embedded documents!
- The only limit for this mechanism is that serialized version (in raw array format) of whole document, must not extend the 4 MB size
- For documents bigger than 4 MB see the [GridFS Section][advanced.gridfs]
- Main difference between `EMongoDocument` and EMongoEmbeddedDocument` is that:
    - EMongoDocument extends from EMongoEmbeddedDocument
    - EMongoDocument is equipped with all methods needed to save its contents into a MongoDB collection
    - You cannot call ie `save()` method on a EMongoEmbeddedDocument

## Defining embedded documents within document {#defining}

**This applies to EMongoDocument and EMongoEmbeddedDocument**

Just define the `embeddedDocuments()` method in yours model class, it should return array of
simple key => value pairs.

- Array values are class names that will be used to instantinate embedded documents
- Array keys are treated as property names of given embedded document class 

example:

~~~
[php]
// ...
// within model class
public function embeddedDocuments()
{
	return array(
		'address' => 'UserAddress',
		'some_other_field_name' => 'AnyEMongoEmbeddedDocumentChildClass',
	);
}

// this will give you access to propeties of model:
$model->address->embeddedExampleField;
$model->some_other_field_name->embeddedExampleField;
~~~

## How to force save of embedded document into collection {#forcesave}

- First we need to get the mongo collection object ie:
    - `$collection = SomeModelClass::model()->getCollection();`
    - `$collection = SomeModelClass::model()->getDb()->collectionName;`
    - `$collection = Yii::app()->getComponent('mongodb')->getConnection()->collectionName;`
- When we have our collection model, we now can force save of embedded document as a regular root document:
    - `$collection->save($ourEmbeddedModel->toArray());`
