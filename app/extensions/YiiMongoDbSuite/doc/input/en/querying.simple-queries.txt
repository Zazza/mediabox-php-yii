Title: Simple queries
Author: Dariusz GÃ³recki <darek.krk@gmail.com>

You can use methods that you have used to with standard Yii `CActiveRecord`'s

- To find only one first matched document simply call

`$model = ModelClass::model()->find()`

- To find document that has some arguments set call 

`$model = ModelClass::model()->findByAttributes(array('attributeName'=>'attributeValue', 'attribute2'=>'otherValue'))`

- You can search models by theyre primary key

`$model = ModelClass::model()->findByPk(new MongoID(/* ... */))`

To understand PK queries refer to [Primary Keys Section][advanced.primaryKeys]

- All of above methods have the 'All' version, ie: `findAll()`, `findAllByAttributes`
- They may return an array of models, or models cursor, we'll cover the cursor later

**This is almost the same behavior like standard Yii ActiveRecord models, refer to them for a basic idea**
